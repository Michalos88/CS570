# JavaScript Projects
Collection of my projects in JavaScript:

1. FizzBuzz:

 Output numbers between 74 and 291.
 If the number is divisible by 3, output the word Buzz instead of the number.
 If the number is divisble by 5, output Fizz to the screen instead of the number.
 If the number is divisible by both, output BuzzFizz to the screen instead of the number


2. Ceasar's Cipher

Deciphering a given message. It is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher.
that increases by 2 after every 3 characters (including symbol characters, which are not encoded), starting at key = 5.
The program saves this message to a file using a text editor.
Then, it prompts the user for the name of the file, decrypt the message stored in the file,
and then write the decrypted message to a new file called solution.txt.

3. Fully customizable TIC-TAC-TOE
